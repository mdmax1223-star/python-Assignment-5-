# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))

# Extracting the first five elements using slicing
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Reversing the extracted list
reversed_first_five = first_five[::-1]

# Printing the results
print(f"First five elements: {first_five}")
print(f"Reversed first five elements: {reversed_first_five}")
